### ðŸ”¬ Physicist turned Software Developer | Linux and Open-Source Enthusiast ðŸ”¬

With a background in Physics and expertise in computer simulations like cellular automata and Monte Carlo simulations,
I have successfully transitioned into software development. I hold a
[Certification in Computer Science for Web Programming](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/42820fef2eef4b389e1d3a4c2c7a91c2/)
from Harvard University. Proficient in Python and Golang, I have developed robust applications and utilized tools like
Django, Django REST Framework and Celery for scalable web development. Additionally, I have experience with tools such as
Terraform and AWS Cloud Services (ECS, Fargate, SNS, SQS, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda) for efficient and secure cloud
infrastructure.

Driven by a personal interest in banking and investing, I have dedicated the past years to developing tailored solutions
for these industries. This experience has provided valuable insights into the specific needs and challenges of the financial
sector. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your organization's success.
