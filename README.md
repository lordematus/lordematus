With a Physics background and expertise in computational simulations (cellular automata, Monte Carlo), I transitioned into software development, earning a Harvard Certification in Computer Science for Web Programming.

Proficient in Python and Golang, I build scalable applications using Django, DRF, Celery, and cloud solutions with AWS (ECS, Fargate, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda) and Terraform.

Passionate about banking, investing, web3 and cryptocurrency technologies, I have developed tailored fintech solutions, gaining deep insights into industry challenges. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate!
